/**
 * Dead-letter queue for unrecoverable event failures.
 *
 * Issue #650. An event that fails for a reason no retry will fix — a malformed
 * payload, a constraint the data permanently violates — must not be dropped on
 * the floor, and must not be retried forever either. The stream needs a place
 * to put it, enough context to debug it, and a durable record that outlives the
 * process.
 *
 * The distinction this module makes is *unrecoverable* versus *not yet
 * recovered*. A failure is not dead because it happened to fail once; it is
 * dead because the retry policy in `retry.ts` gave up. The queue therefore
 * counts attempts against a configured ceiling and only then dead-letters, so
 * a transient blip that survived three attempts lands in the queue only because
 * the system genuinely could not make progress.
 *
 * A dead letter keeps everything needed to reproduce and fix the failure:
 * the raw payload, the topic, the transaction and ledger it came from, the
 * error, and the attempt count. It deliberately keeps the raw `value` even
 * though the logger redacts payload bodies — a redacted queue is useless for
 * debugging, and the queue is an operator-facing table, not a log stream.
 *
 * The queue is intentionally append-only. Requeueing moves an event back into
 * the live stream rather than editing history, so an operator can always
 * reconstruct what failed and what was done about it.
