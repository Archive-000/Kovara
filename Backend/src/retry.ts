/**
 * Retry and backoff for transient processing failures.
 *
 * Issue #649. The indexer talks to two unreliable dependencies — a Postgres
 * connection pool and a Soroban RPC endpoint — and a naive "retry everything"
 * loop is actively harmful in both directions:
 *
 *   - Retrying a *permanent* failure (a malformed payload, a constraint
 *     violation, a 4xx from the provider) burns the retry budget on work that
 *     can never succeed, delays the dead-letter signal, and hides the real
 *     error behind a wall of identical log lines.
 *   - Retrying a *transient* failure (a dropped socket, a statement timeout)
 *     only once turns a blip into an outage.
 *
 * This module therefore draws the line explicitly:
 *
 *   - {@link classifyFailure} sorts an error into `transient` or `permanent`
 *     from its `code`, its HTTP status when present, and its message.
 *   - {@link withRetry} consults that classification, so a permanent error
 *     fails fast on the first attempt while a transient one is retried up to
 *     `maxAttempts`.
 *   - {@link isTransientError} and {@link isPermanentError} are exported so the
 *     stream and handler layers can make the same decision without duplicating
 *     the classification rules.
 *
 * Backoff is exponential with full jitter, capped at {@link MAX_BACKOFF_MS}.
 * Full jitter (`random() * backoff`) rather than a fixed delay matters here:
 * when a provider restarts, every in-flight replica fails at the same instant,
 * and a deterministic schedule would have all of them retry in lockstep and
 * reproduce the overload that caused the failure. Jitter spreads the retries
 * across the window.
 *
 * Every attempt boundary is logged, including the final give-up, so "how many
 * attempts did this get before it was dead-lettered" is answerable from logs
 * alone — the durable record only keeps the last error, not the history.
