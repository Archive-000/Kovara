 * If the relationship already exists, the handler returns immediately without

 * row is written and counts remain unchanged.

 * follower and the following count of one account while the edge is invisible
 * in either list, because a client filters `x !== self`. Accepting it because
 * the read path already refuses it means the rule holds only as long as every
 * caller happens to remember to apply it.
