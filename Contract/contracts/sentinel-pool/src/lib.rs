#![no_std]
//! `SentinelPool` — manages verifier staking, governance thresholds, withdrawals,
//! and fraud slashing for the sentinel set.
//!
//! # One aggregate, maintained not recomputed
//!
//! `total_stake` is a stored running total, updated by `stake`, `withdraw` and
//! `slash` with `checked_add` / `checked_sub`. Every mutation writes the
//! per-address balance and the aggregate in the same call, and checks the
//! arithmetic **before** either write, so the aggregate can never disagree with
//! the balances it summarizes and an arithmetic failure leaves both untouched.
//!
//! # Emergency pause
//!
//! `pause` stops value movement without freezing the pool's configuration.
//! [`SentinelPool::pause`] carries the full matrix; the short version is that
//! `stake`, `withdraw` and `slash` refuse with [`Error::PoolPaused`], while the
//! pause control itself, the configuration setters and every read keep working —
//! because the controls you need during an incident are exactly the ones that
//! must not be frozen.
//!
//! # Leaving the set is a lifecycle event
//!
//! A sentinel with a non-zero balance cannot withdraw down to zero: it would
//! silently de-register the address with nothing recording why. `deregister` is
//! that record. After deregistration the withdrawal lock still applies, and a
//! further challenge period must elapse before the balance can leave the pool —
//! so a sentinel cannot deregister and immediately withdraw to escape a slash
//! review that is still running.
//!
//! `is_eligible` is the query that ties these together: it answers "would this
//! address count as an active sentinel at ledger N?" in one read, without the
//! caller re-deriving the floor, the lock and the deregistration state by hand.
//! # Slashing is a governed, reversible process, not a one-way write
//!
//! A slash takes a sentinel's stake immediately, but it is the start of a
//! process rather than the end of one:
//!
//! ```text
//!  slash ──► Pending ──appeal──► Pending ──resolve──► Upheld | Reversed
//!              │                  │
//!              └──────────────────┘
//!         appeal only until `appeal_deadline`
//! ```
//!
//! * **Evidence.** [`SlashEvidence`] carries a proof reference, a URI and a
//!   content hash. They are stored on the record and republished on
//!   [`SlashedEvent`], so an off-chain audit consumer never has to infer *why*
//!   a balance changed.
//! * **A bounded appeal window.** A slash records `appeal_deadline =
//!   slashed_at + appeal_window`. An appeal after that ledger is refused with
//!   [`Error::AppealWindowClosed`] — the window is what stops an appeal from
//!   being raised at an arbitrary point in the future to relitigate a settled
//!   matter.
//! * **Exactly one resolution.** [`SentinelPool::resolve_slash`] upholds or
//!   reverses a slash once. A reversal restores the slashed amount with
//!   `checked_add`; a second resolution is [`Error::AlreadyResolved`].
//!
//! # Governance authorization
//!
//! Every slash operation — applying, appealing, resolving — requires the
//! configured governance address, resolved from storage by [`SentinelPool::require_governance`].
//! A missing configuration is [`Error::GovernanceNotConfigured`], not a
//! fall-through to the caller: an ungoverned pool cannot be slashed at all,
//! rather than being governed by whoever happened to sign the transaction.
//! Refused calls leave the stake and the replay state untouched.

/// Upper bound on the appeal window, in ledger sequence numbers.
///
/// The deadline is `slashed_at + appeal_window` and is stored in a `u64`. An
/// unrepresentable window would not be a long appeal period — it would be an
/// appeal period that cannot be expressed at all, so the boundary would have to

pub const MAX_APPEAL_WINDOW_LEDGERS: u64 = 6_000_000;
//! # The withdrawal lock is a window, not a counter
//!
//! A sentinel's lock is stored as a single ledger — `staked_at` — and the lock
//! runs until `staked_at + lock_period`. Everything about the lock follows from
//! that one value being an *absolute ledger* rather than a countdown:
//!
//! * **Arithmetic is checked, not saturating.** `unlock_at` is derived with
//!   `checked_add`; an unrepresentable window returns
//!   [`Error::InvalidLockPeriod`] instead of silently pinning itself to
//!   `u64::MAX`, which would be a lock that never expires.
//! * **A top-up does not move the window.** While the lock is still running,
//!   `stake` leaves `staked_at` untouched. A sentinel that keeps topping up
//!   cannot push its own unlock date further out, and — equally important — a
//!   top-up cannot be used to escape a lock that is about to expire by resetting
//!   it. Once the window has elapsed, the next `stake` starts a fresh one.
//!
//! # A slash is identified by a proof, not by a (sentinel, reason) pair
//!
//! Replay protection used to key on `(sentinel, reason)` — a pair of a contract
//! address and a `Symbol`. That key is not unique: two genuinely distinct
//! incidents against the same sentinel can share a reason code, and the second
//! one is then refused as a replay of the first. Conversely a single incident
//! relabelled with a different reason slips through twice.
//!
//! `slash` now takes an explicit `proof_id`, chosen by the caller and required
//! to be globally unique within the pool. A [`SlashProof`] record is stored
//! under it, so "this identifier has been used" is a fact the contract can
//! answer, and an auditor can join a slash back to the evidence that justified
//! it.
//!
//! # Slash amounts are bounded before anything is written
//!
//! `amount` is checked against three bounds in a fixed order — positive, at most
//! the current stake, leaving at least `min_stake` behind — and the balance map
//! is written only after all three pass. Each failure has its own error, so a
//! caller can tell a malformed amount from an unaffordable one.
//! # Initialization is a precondition, not a convention
//!
//! Every state-changing entry point calls `require_initialized` before it
//! touches storage or asks for authorization. An uninitialized pool therefore
//! rejects `stake`, `withdraw`, `set_threshold`, `set_min_stake` and `slash`
//! with [`Error::NotInitialized`] instead of silently behaving like a pool whose
//! `min_stake` is `0` and whose `lock_period` is `0` — a state in which anybody
//! could stake nothing and anybody could be slashed against a stake that does
//! not exist.
//!
//! `initialize` is itself all-or-nothing: every parameter is validated before
//! the first write, so a rejected call leaves `DataKey::Admin` absent and the
//! contract still initializable. See [`SentinelPool::initialize`].
//! # The minimum-stake floor is a registration rule
//!
//! An address with a non-zero stake is a *registered sentinel*, and a registered
//! sentinel is expected to keep at least `min_stake` on deposit for as long as
//! it stays registered. `stake` enforces that on the way in and `withdraw`
//! enforces it on the way out, so the floor holds at every observable balance —
//! including the very first one.
//!
//! The consequence, stated plainly: **a partial withdrawal may take a sentinel
//! down to exactly `min_stake` and no further.** Withdrawing to zero is not
//! available through `withdraw`, because a zero balance would silently
//! de-register the address, and the pool has no separate deregistration step to
//! record why the address stopped being a sentinel. Leaving the set is a
//! lifecycle event, not a side effect of an arithmetic result.
//!
//! # Withdrawal accounting is checked end to end
//!
//! `withdraw` validates `amount > 0`, `amount <= balance` and the resulting
//! remainder in that order, and writes the balance map only once every check has
//! passed. A rejected withdrawal leaves the sentinel's balance byte-for-byte
//! unchanged and emits nothing.
//!
//! # Reads never mutate
//!
//! `balance`, `stake_of` and `total_active_stake` are views. They report
//! storage and ledger state and write nothing, so an indexer can poll them
//! without constructing a transaction or perturbing the pool.
